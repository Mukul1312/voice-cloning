prep_narration.py — turn the diary devotional text (PART A framing + PART B his first-person diary)
into VoxCPM-ready utterances: transliterate IAST->ASCII (our locked pronunciation step) and split into
natural sentence-length chunks (each well under the ~20s autoregressive ceiling, cut at sentence ends
so prosody flows). Writes data/narration/diary_chunks.txt (one utterance per line) for cloud/narrate.py.
